# WHAT IS PERMISSION ELEVATION AND WHY IS IT USED?

It can be tempting to always logon to a host as the administrator or root user. However doing so means if your session were ever compromised you would completely lose control of your host. Likewise, you risk rouge software acting on your behalf or running commands which have a broader effect than intended. For these reasons it's a best practice to always create a standard user account for the administrator to use and force them to elevate themselves when acting as an administrator.

In a Linux environment this is most commonly done with the `sudo` command. Determining who is able to run `sudo` is accomplished with the `/etc/sudoers` file. This file determines who is able to act as an administrator and what is required to actually execute a sudo'd command (a password in most cases).

Sometimes it's necessary for one user to assume the identity of another for an entire session and not just a single command. In these cases the command `su` is used. Invoking it with no arguments is the same as invoking it with `root`: `su - root`. An administrator is able to `su - USERNAME` and assume the identity of that user on the localhost provided they are able to authenticate or elevate permissions to that user. The `exit` command can be used to end the session and return to the standard user prompt. There are many options for the `su` command but for the majority of everyday tasks `sudo` will likely be sufficient and preferred.
