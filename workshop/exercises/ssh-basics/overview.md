# SSH BASICS

SSH is a protocol which facilitates the creation of a secure text-based shell
connection between machines. While many developers use SSH every day, the
particulars of what's happening under the hood are often overlooked.

## HOW SSH USES YOUR KEYS

In SSHv1, the basic form of asymmetric cryptography is used. During connection,
the server encrypts a message for the user and it's expected that the user's
machine is capable of decrypting it and responding with the correct plain text.
This is known as a cryptographic challenge.

In SSHv2, the user sends a cryptographic signature that the server validates
prior to granting access.

In both cases, the result is the same: the server assumes that possession of
the private key is proof of identity.

If you're curious how the server is able to do this, check out the next section
which covers the `authorized_keys` file.

## PERMISSIONS

Due to the importance of keeping a private key secret, SSH expects your key to
have a very restrictive set of permissions. It is outside the scope of this
workshop to explain how this works, but the correct "mode" for a private key
is `0400`.

This prevents any action on a file except reading by the owner. Should you ever
need to edit this file, you can change to mode `0600` to enable write access by
the owner.

You can set the mode of a file with the following command:

```
chmod <mode> <filename>
```

## SPECIFYING A USER

When connecting to a remote machine, SSH will attempt to connect as the current
user on the machine. You can see the current user by running `echo $USER` or
`whoami`. Assuming the current user is `alice`, the following three commands are
interchangeable:

```
ssh workshop.learndeployment.com
ssh alice@workshop.learndeployment.com
ssh -l alice workshop.learndeployment.com
```

## SPECIFYING A PRIVATE KEY

When connecting to a remote machine, SSH will attempt to use one of several
default private keys:

- `~/.ssh/identity` for SSHv1
- `~/.ssh/id_rsa` or `~/.ssh/id_dsa` for SSHv2

If you have a specific private key you wish to use, you can override this
default behavior with the `-i` flag like so:

```
ssh -i /path/to/key workshop.learndeployment.com
```

## EXERCISE

This exercise comes with a private key. Use it in conjunction with the `ssh`
command to connect to the server running at `workshop.learndeployment.com`.
You will need to connect as the user `ubuntu`.
