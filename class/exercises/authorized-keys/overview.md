# AUTHORIZED KEYS

We learned in the previous section about the underlying mechanics of asymmetric cryptography and how SSH uses your public and private keypair to ensure a secure trusted connection can be established between two machines. Perhaps after that primer you're wondering how the server is able to verify signatures or encrypt messages for any given user. The answer to this question lies in the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file. 

A few things should jump out at you about this file path. The first is that it lives inside a user's home directory (`~`). That means every user has their own `authorized_keys` file, as opposed to the system keeping a global one. Further, the file is stored in the `~/.ssh` directory which is also the default location where ssh keys are stored. It's important to note that the `authorized_keys` file is only used by SSH when a machine receives a request for an *incoming* ssh connection. Outgoing SSH requests do not use the `authorized_keys` file in any way.

The format of the `authorized_keys` file is relatively straightforward. A valid `authorized_keys` file contains string representations of one or more public keys delimited with a newline character. When a request to connect to a machine as a particular user is received, SSH reads that user's `authorized_keys` file into memory and uses ALL of the public keys it contains in an effort to validate the connection using one of the cryptographic scenarios outlined in the previous SSH Keys section.

Because possession of the private key is proof of identity, the assumption is that if the machine requesting the connection can either produce a signature that can be verified using one of the public keys in the `authorized_keys` file, or correctly complete a cryptographic challenge generated using one of those public keys in the case of SSHv1 then the connection should be allowed. 

On most Linux distributions the `authorized_keys` file and `~/.ssh` directory might not exist by default and will need to be created by the user. The `.ssh` directory should have `0700` permissions and the `authorized_keys` file `0600`.
